# A snowflake data model for a pet insurance company.

### Project Overview

A simulated example of how a snowflake data model could be structured for a pet insurance company which involves identifying the key facts and dimensions relevant to the business. It provides a structured and efficient way to manage and analyze data related to claims, policies, pets, and owners.

1. Identify the Business Requirements

For a pet insurance company, the key metrics might include:

    Total claims processed
    Premiums collected
    Number of policies issued

2. Define the Fact Table

Fact Table: Claims_Fact

    Columns:
        Claim_ID (Primary Key)
        Policy_ID (Foreign Key)
        Date_ID (Foreign Key)
        Amount_Claimed
        Amount_Paid
        Claim_Status (e.g., Approved, Denied)

3. Identify Dimension Tables

Dimension Tables:

    Policy_Dimension
        Columns:
            Policy_ID (Primary Key)
            Policy_Number
            Start_Date
            End_Date
            Premium_Amount
            Coverage_Type_ID (Foreign Key)

    Coverage_Type_Dimension
        Columns:
            Coverage_Type_ID (Primary Key)
            Coverage_Description (e.g., Accident Only, Comprehensive)

    Pet_Dimension
        Columns:
            Pet_ID (Primary Key)
            Pet_Name
            Pet_Type (e.g., Dog, Cat)
            Breed
            Age
            Owner_ID (Foreign Key)

    Owner_Dimension
        Columns:
            Owner_ID (Primary Key)
            Owner_Name
            Contact_Info
            Address_ID (Foreign Key)

    Address_Dimension
        Columns:
            Address_ID (Primary Key)
            Street
            City
            State
            Zip_Code

    Date_Dimension
        Columns:
            Date_ID (Primary Key)
            Date
            Month
            Year
            Day_of_Week

4. Establish Relationships

   The Claims_Fact table references the Policy_Dimension and Date_Dimension through foreign keys.
   The Policy_Dimension references the Coverage_Type_Dimension.
   The Pet_Dimension references the Owner_Dimension, which in turn references the Address_Dimension.

5. Design the Schema

## Claims_Fact

```
    | Claim_ID |
    | Policy_ID (FK) |
    | Date_ID (FK) |
    | Amount_Claimed |
    | Amount_Paid |
    | Claim_Status |

    ---

    ## Policy_Dimension

    | Policy_ID |
    | Policy_Number |
    | Start_Date |
    | End_Date |
    | Premium_Amount |
    | Coverage_Type_ID (FK) |

    ---

    ## Coverage_Type_Dimension

    | Coverage_Type_ID |
    | Coverage_Description |

    ---

    ## Pet_Dimension

    | Pet_ID |
    | Pet_Name |
    | Pet_Type |
    | Breed |
    | Age |
    | Owner_ID (FK) |

    ---

    ## Owner_Dimension

    | Owner_ID |
    | Owner_Name |
    | Contact_Info |
    | Address_ID (FK) |

    ---

    ## Address_Dimension

    | Address_ID |
    | Street |
    | City |
    | State |
    | Zip_Code |

    ---

    ## Date_Dimension

    | Date_ID |
    | Date |
    | Month |
    | Year |
    | Day_of_Week |

    ---
```

6. Load Data

   Use ETL processes to extract data from source systems (e.g., policy management systems, claims processing systems) and load it into the respective tables.

7. Optimize for Query Performance

   Indexing: Create indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns to speed up join operations and improve query performance. For example, indexing `Policy_ID` in the `Claims_Fact` table and `Date_ID` in the `Date_Dimension` table can significantly enhance performance for queries that involve these fields.

   Partitioning: If the dataset is large, consider partitioning the fact table by date or policy type to improve query performance and manageability.

8. Test and Validate

   Run various sample queries to ensure that the data model meets the business requirements.

   For example:

   - Total claims processed by year
   - Average claim amount by pet type
   - Claims status distribution by coverage type

   Data Validation: Ensure that the data loaded into the tables is accurate and consistent. This may involve checking for duplicates, ensuring referential integrity, and validating that the data types are correct.

9. Documentation

   Document the data model, including the purpose of each table, the relationships between tables, and any business rules that apply. This documentation will be valuable for future maintenance and for onboarding new team members.

10. Maintenance and Updates

    Regularly review and update the data model as business requirements change. This may involve adding new dimensions, modifying existing tables, or optimizing performance based on query patterns.

11. Reporting and Analytics

    Utilize business intelligence (BI) tools to create dashboards and reports based on the snowflake schema. This will allow stakeholders to visualize key metrics, trends, and insights derived from the data.

Example Use Cases

    - Claims Analysis: Analyze claims data to identify trends in claims by pet type, coverage type, or geographic location.
    - Policy Performance: Evaluate the performance of different insurance policies based on claims made and premiums collected.
    - Customer Insights: Gain insights into customer demographics and pet ownership patterns to tailor marketing strategies.
